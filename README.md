# TogetherBridges

## Objectives

- Enhance online presence for NGOs through professional webpages.
- Facilitate volunteer engagement and management.
- Streamline secure donations via Stripe integration.
- Foster partnerships and network expansion for greater impact.


## Idea

The ReactJS web app was created to assist NGOs in enhancing their online presence and connecting with volunteers. It offered features such as webpage creation, professional landing pages, and a Dashboard for easy content management. NGOs could showcase their organization and events, share their mission, and collect donations securely through Stripe integration. The app provided a comprehensive platform to expand their network and foster partnerships, contributing to the growth and success of the NGOs.
