## Idea

The ReactJS web app was created to assist NGOs in enhancing their online presence and connecting with volunteers. It offered features such as webpage creation, professional landing pages, and a Dashboard for easy content management.

The app provided a comprehensive platform to expand their network and foster partnerships, contributing to the growth and success of the NGOs.
